  <p>
    I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Monitra, UK and a PhD Candidate at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), South Korea, advised by Prof. Dongsoo Han.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research focuses on robust domain-invariant inertial localization in real-time federated edge computing. I work on foundation models, navigation & localization, hardware-aware AI, embodied AI, and zero-shot/few-shot learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've developed AIoT-enabled inertial localization systems, deep learning-based sensor fusion frameworks, and privacy-preserving navigation solutions. My expertise spans designing lightweight transformers for TinyML-based motion tracking, neural network quantization, and real-time FPGA-based SLAM acceleration.
