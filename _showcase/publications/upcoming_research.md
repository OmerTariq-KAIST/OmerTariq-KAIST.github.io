    <h4>Upcoming Research</h4>
    <hr />
    
    <p>My ongoing research focuses on several key areas that will lead to upcoming publications:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>NanoMST:</strong> A hardware-aware multiscale transformer for TinyML-based inertial motion tracking</li>
        <li><strong>ConvXformer:</strong> A differentially private hybrid ConvNeXt-Transformer architecture for inertial navigation</li>
        <li><strong>TRIP:</strong> A real-time deep inertial odometry framework for pose-invariant pedestrian navigation</li>
        <li><strong>Personalized Federated Learning:</strong> Using model-agnostic meta-learning for neural inertial localization</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These projects address critical challenges in mobile computing, privacy-preserving AI, and resource-efficient deep learning.</p>
